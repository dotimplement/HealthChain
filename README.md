Connect your AI models to any healthcare system with a few lines of Python üí´ üè•.

Integrating AI with electronic health records (EHRs) is complex, manual, and time-consuming. Let's try to change that.


```bash
pip install healthchain
```

## Why use HealthChain?
-  **EHR integrations are manual and time-consuming** - **HealthChainAPI** abstracts away complexities so you can focus on AI development, not learning FHIR APIs, CDS Hooks, and authentication schemes.
-  **Healthcare data is fragmented and complex** - **InteropEngine** handles the conversion between FHIR, CDA, and HL7v2 so you don't have to become an expert in healthcare data standards.
-  [**Most healthcare data is unstructured**](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10566734/) - HealthChain **Pipelines** are optimized for real-time AI and NLP applications that deal with realistic healthcare data.
- **Built by health tech developers, for health tech developers** - HealthChain is tech stack agnostic, modular, and easily extensible with built-in compliance and audit features.

## HealthChainAPI

The HealthChainAPI provides a secure integration layer that coordinates multiple healthcare systems in a single application.

### Multi-Protocol Support

Connect to multiple healthcare data sources and protocols:

```python
from healthchain.gateway import (
    HealthChainAPI, FHIRGateway,
    CDSHooksService, NoteReaderService
)

# Create your healthcare application
app = HealthChainAPI(
    title="My Healthcare AI App",
    description="AI-powered patient care platform"
)

# FHIR for patient data from multiple EHRs
fhir = FHIRGateway()
fhir.add_source("epic", "fhir://fhir.epic.com/r4?client_id=...")
fhir.add_source("medplum", "fhir://api.medplum.com/fhir/R4/?client_id=...")

# CDS Hooks for real-time clinical decision support
cds = CDSHooksService()

@cds.hook("patient-view", id="allergy-alerts")
def check_allergies(request):
    # Your AI logic here
    return {"cards": [...]}

# SOAP for clinical document processing
notes = NoteReaderService()

@notes.method("ProcessDocument")
def process_note(request):
    # Your NLP pipeline here
    return processed_document

# Register everything
app.register_gateway(fhir)
app.register_service(cds)
app.register_service(notes)

# Your API now handles:
# /fhir/* - Patient data, observations, etc.
# /cds/* - Real-time clinical alerts
# /soap/* - Clinical document processing

# Deploy with uvicorn
if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    uvicorn.run(app, port=8888)
```

### FHIR Operations with AI Enhancement

```python
from healthchain.gateway import FHIRGateway
from fhir.resources.patient import Patient

gateway = FHIRGateway()
gateway.add_source("epic", "fhir://fhir.epic.com/r4?...")

# Add AI transformations to FHIR data
@gateway.transform(Patient)
def enhance_patient(id: str, source: str = None) -> Patient:
    patient = gateway.read(Patient, id, source)

    # Get lab results and process with AI
    lab_results = gateway.search(
        Observation,
        {"patient": id, "category": "laboratory"},
        source
    )
    insights = nlp_pipeline.process(patient, lab_results)

    # Add AI summary to patient record
    patient.extension = patient.extension or []
    patient.extension.append({
        "url": "http://healthchain.org/fhir/summary",
        "valueString": insights.summary
    })

    # Update the patient record
    gateway.update(patient, source)
    return patient

# Automatically available at: GET /fhir/transform/Patient/123?source=epic
```

## Pipeline
Pipelines provide a flexible way to build and manage processing pipelines for NLP and ML tasks that can easily integrate with complex healthcare systems.

### Building a pipeline

```python
from healthchain.io.containers import Document
from healthchain.pipeline import Pipeline
from healthchain.pipeline.components import (
    TextPreProcessor,
    SpacyNLP,
    TextPostProcessor,
)

# Initialize the pipeline
nlp_pipeline = Pipeline[Document]()

# Add TextPreProcessor component
preprocessor = TextPreProcessor()
nlp_pipeline.add_node(preprocessor)

# Add Model component (assuming we have a pre-trained model)
spacy_nlp = SpacyNLP.from_model_id("en_core_sci_sm")
nlp_pipeline.add_node(spacy_nlp)

# Add TextPostProcessor component
postprocessor = TextPostProcessor(
    postcoordination_lookup={
        "heart attack": "myocardial infarction",
        "high blood pressure": "hypertension",
    }
)
nlp_pipeline.add_node(postprocessor)

# Build the pipeline
nlp = nlp_pipeline.build()

# Use the pipeline
result = nlp(Document("Patient has a history of heart attack and high blood pressure."))

print(f"Entities: {result.nlp.get_entities()}")
```

#### Working with healthcare data formats
Adapters handle conversion between healthcare formats (CDA, FHIR) and internal Document objects for seamless EHR integration.

```python
from healthchain.io import CdaAdapter, Document
from healthchain.models import CdaRequest

adapter = CdaAdapter()

# Parse healthcare data into Document
cda_request = CdaRequest(document="<CDA XML content>")
doc = adapter.parse(cda_request)

# Process with your pipeline
processed_doc = nlp_pipeline(doc)

# Access extracted clinical data
print(f"Problems: {processed_doc.fhir.problem_list}")
print(f"Medications: {processed_doc.fhir.medication_list}")

# Convert back to healthcare format
response = adapter.format(processed_doc)
```

### Using pre-built pipelines
Pre-built pipelines are use case specific end-to-end workflows optimized for common healthcare AI tasks.

```python
from healthchain.pipeline import MedicalCodingPipeline
from healthchain.models import CdaRequest

# Load from model ID
pipeline = MedicalCodingPipeline.from_model_id(
    model="blaze999/Medical-NER", task="token-classification", source="huggingface"
)

# Simple end-to-end processing
cda_request = CdaRequest(document="<CDA XML content>")
response = pipeline.process_request(cda_request)

# Or manual control for document access
from healthchain.io import CdaAdapter
adapter = CdaAdapter()
doc = adapter.parse(cda_request)
doc = pipeline(doc)
# Access: doc.fhir.problem_list, doc.fhir.medication_list
response = adapter.format(doc)
```

## Interoperability

The InteropEngine is a template-based system that allows you to convert between FHIR, CDA, and HL7v2.

```python
from healthchain.interop import create_interop, FormatType

engine = create_interop()

with open("tests/data/test_cda.xml", "r") as f:
    cda_data = f.read()

# Convert CDA to FHIR
fhir_resources = engine.to_fhir(cda_data, src_format=FormatType.CDA)

# Convert FHIR to CDA
cda_data = engine.from_fhir(fhir_resources, dest_format=FormatType.CDA)
```

## Sandbox

Test your AI applications in realistic healthcare contexts with [CDS Hooks](https://cds-hooks.org/) sandbox environments.

```python
import healthchain as hc
from healthchain.sandbox.use_cases import ClinicalDecisionSupport

@hc.sandbox
class MyCDS(ClinicalDecisionSupport):
    def __init__(self):
        self.pipeline = SummarizationPipeline.from_model_id("facebook/bart-large-cnn")

    @hc.ehr(workflow="encounter-discharge")
    def ehr_database_client(self):
        return self.data_generator.generate_prefetch()

cds = MyCDS()
cds.start_sandbox()

# Run with: healthchain run mycds.py
```
