"Your hospital stay for pneumonia is now complete and you are cleared for discharge home today. During your 5-day admission, you received intravenous antibiotics which have now been changed to oral Co-amoxiclav 625mg three times daily for 5 more days, and you should complete this full course. Take regular Paracetamol 1g four times daily as needed for fever or discomfort, and continue using your regular inhalers as prescribed. You should rest at home for at least 7 days and gradually increase your activity level as you feel able. Use 2-3 pillows when sleeping to help with breathing and try to drink at least 6-8 glasses of water daily. Call your GP or return to hospital immediately if you develop increased shortness of breath, chest pain, fever above 38Â°C, or coughing up blood. Schedule a follow-up appointment with your GP within 7 days, and attend your chest X-ray appointment scheduled for next Thursday at 2:30 PM to confirm the pneumonia has cleared.

"Mr. Thompson's discharge from the Stroke Unit to Cedar House Rehabilitation Centre has been approved for tomorrow morning contingent on three requirements: the pharmacy must prepare his modified-release Baclofen 20mg and new anticoagulation medication pack (Apixaban 5mg) for collection by his daughter before 9am, hospital transport must be confirmed for an 11am pickup (bariatric ambulance and two crew members required due to hoisting needs), and the rehabilitation centre must receive his completed medication administration record by fax before accepting admission. The ward needs to arrange collection of his pressure-relieving mattress from the equipment library for transport with him, and his current hospital bed must be deep-cleaned after discharge due to previous MRSA status. Prior to discharge, the Stroke Early Supported Discharge team must complete their initial assessment at 8:30am, and his daughter needs to bring appropriate clothing as hospital gowns cannot be taken to the rehabilitation facility. The patient requires two additional outpatient appointments to be booked: a swallowing assessment with Speech and Language Therapy within 7 days, and a follow-up with the Stroke Consultant in 4 weeks. The social worker must confirm that the family has received the rehabilitation centre's payment schedule and admission documentation. Additionally, the ward must ensure his discharge summary is sent to both his GP and the rehabilitation centre, with a copy of his anticoagulation monitoring booklet and most recent INR results."
