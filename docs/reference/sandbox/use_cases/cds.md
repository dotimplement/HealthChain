# Use Cases

## Clinical Decision Support (CDS)

CDS workflows are based on [CDS Hooks](https://cds-hooks.org/). CDS Hooks is an [HL7](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org) published specification for clinical decision support. CDS hooks communicate using [FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)](https://hl7.org/fhir/). For more information you can consult the [official documentation](https://cds-hooks.org/).

| When      | Where | What you receive            | What you send back         |
| :-------- | :-----| :-------------------------- |----------------------------|
| Triggered at certain events during a clinician's workflow, e.g. when a patient record is opened. | EHR  | The context of the event and FHIR resources that are requested by your service. e.g. patient ID, `Encounter` and `Patient`.  | “Cards” displaying text, actionable suggestions, or links to launch a [SMART](https://smarthealthit.org/) app from within the workflow.      |

## Data Flow

| Stage | Input | Internal Data Representation | Output |
|-------|-------|------------------------------|--------|
| Client | N/A | N/A | `CdsFhirData` |
| Service | `CdsRequest` | `CdsFhirData` | `CdsResponse` |


[CdsFhirConnector](../../pipeline/connectors/cdsfhirconnector.md) handles the conversion of `CDSRequests` :material-swap-horizontal: `CdsFhirData` :material-swap-horizontal: `CdsResponse` in a HealthChain pipeline.

Attributes of `CdsFhirData` are:

- `context`
- `prefetch`

## Supported Workflows

| Workflow Name | Description | Trigger | Maturity |
|-----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `patient-view` | Triggered when a patient chart is opened | Opening a patient's chart | ✅ |
| `order-select` | Triggered when a new order is selected | Selecting a new order | ⏳ |
| `order-sign` | Triggered when orders are being signed | Signing orders | ⏳ |
| `encounter-discharge` | Triggered when a patient is being discharged | Discharging a patient | ✅ |



## Generated API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Function Name | API Protocol |
|------|--------|----------|--------------|
| `/cds-services` | GET | `cds_discovery` | REST |
| `/cds-services/{id}` | POST | `cds_service` | REST |

### Example `CDSRequest`

```json
{
   "hookInstance" : "23f1a303-991f-4118-86c5-11d99a39222e",
   "fhirServer" : "https://fhir.example.org",
   "hook" : "patient-view",
   "context" : {
     "patientId" : "1288992",
     "userId" : "Practitioner/example"
    },
   "prefetch" : {
      "patientToGreet" : {
        "resourceType" : "Patient",
        "gender" : "male",
        "birthDate" : "1925-12-23",
        "id" : "1288992",
        "active" : true
      }
   }
}
```
### Example `CDSResponse`

```json
{
  "summary": "Bilirubin: Based on the age of this patient consider overlaying bilirubin [Mass/volume] results over a time-based risk chart",
  "indicator": "info",
  "detail": "The focus of this app is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment.",
  "source": {
    "label": "Intermountain",
    "url": null
  },
  "links": [
    {
      "label": "Bilirubin SMART app",

   }
  ]
}
