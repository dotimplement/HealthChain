## Overview

This tutorial will demonstrate how to deploy any trained ML model as a production-ready healthcare API with FHIR input/output, multi-EHR connectivity, and comprehensive monitoring.

## What You'll Learn

- **Model serving architecture** - Deploy Hugging Face, scikit-learn, PyTorch, and custom models
- **FHIR-native endpoints** - Serve predictions with structured healthcare data formats
- **Multi-EHR integration** - Connect your model to live FHIR servers for real-time inference
- **Healthcare data validation** - Ensure type-safe input/output with Pydantic models
- **Production monitoring** - Track model performance, data drift, and API health
- **Scalable deployment** - Configure auto-scaling and load balancing for healthcare workloads

## Architecture

The example will showcase:

1. **Model Packaging** - Wrap any ML model with HealthChain's deployment framework
2. **FHIR Endpoint Creation** - Automatically generate OpenAPI-compliant healthcare APIs
3. **Real-time Inference** - Process FHIR resources and return structured predictions
4. **Multi-source Integration** - Connect to Epic, Cerner, and other FHIR systems
5. **Performance Monitoring** - Track latency, throughput, and prediction quality
6. **Security & Compliance** - Implement OAuth2, audit logging, and data governance

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Clinical Decision Support** - Deploy diagnostic or prognostic models in EHR workflows
- **Population Health** - Serve risk stratification models for large patient cohorts
- **Research Platforms** - Make trained models available to clinical researchers
- **AI-powered Applications** - Build healthcare apps with ML-driven features

## Example Models

We'll show deployment patterns for:
- **Clinical NLP models** - Named entity recognition, clinical coding, text classification
- **Diagnostic models** - Medical imaging analysis, lab result interpretation
- **Risk prediction models** - Readmission risk, mortality prediction, drug interactions
- **Recommendation systems** - Treatment recommendations, medication optimization

## Prerequisites

- A trained ML model (any framework supported)
- Understanding of FHIR resources and healthcare data standards
- Python environment with HealthChain installed
- Basic knowledge of API deployment concepts

## Coming Soon

We're building comprehensive examples covering multiple model types and deployment scenarios!

In the meantime, explore our [Gateway documentation](../reference/gateway/gateway.md) to understand the deployment infrastructure.
