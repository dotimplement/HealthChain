## Overview

This comprehensive tutorial will show you how to build a patient data aggregation system that connects to multiple EHR systems, combines patient records, and enriches them with AI-powered insights.

## What You'll Learn

- **Multi-source FHIR connectivity** - Connect to Epic, Cerner, and other FHIR servers simultaneously
- **Patient record matching** - Identify and link patient records across different systems
- **Data deduplication** - Handle overlapping and duplicate information intelligently
- **NLP enrichment** - Extract insights from clinical notes and add structured data
- **Unified patient timelines** - Create comprehensive patient views across all systems
- **Real-time synchronization** - Keep data updated across multiple sources

## Architecture

The example will demonstrate:

1. **FHIR Gateway Setup** - Configure connections to multiple healthcare systems
2. **Patient Matching Algorithm** - Match patients across systems using demographics and identifiers
3. **Data Aggregation Pipeline** - Combine and normalize patient data from different sources
4. **NLP Processing** - Extract medical entities and conditions from clinical notes
5. **Conflict Resolution** - Handle discrepancies between different data sources
6. **Export & Analytics** - Generate unified datasets for research and analytics

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Healthcare Analytics** - Create comprehensive datasets for population health studies
- **Clinical Research** - Aggregate patient cohorts from multiple institutions
- **AI/ML Training** - Build rich, multi-source datasets for model training
- **Patient Care Coordination** - Provide clinicians with complete patient views

## Prerequisites

- Multiple FHIR server connections (we'll show how to set up test environments)
- Basic understanding of FHIR resources (Patient, Observation, Condition)
- Python environment with HealthChain installed

## Coming Soon

We're actively developing this example and it will be available soon!

In the meantime, check out our [Gateway documentation](../reference/gateway/fhir_gateway.md) to understand the fundamentals of multi-source FHIR connectivity.
