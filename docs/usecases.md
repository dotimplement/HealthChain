# Use Cases

## Clinical Decision Support (CDS)

[CDS Hooks](https://cds-hooks.org/) is an [HL7](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org) published specification for clinical decision support. For more information please consult the [official documentation](https://cds-hooks.org/).

| When      | Where | What you receive            | What you send back         |
| :-------- | :-----| :-------------------------- |----------------------------|
| Triggered at certain events during a clinician's workflow, e.g. when a patient record is opened. | EHR  | The context of the event and FHIR resources that are requested by your service. e.g. patient ID, `Encounter` and `Patient`.  | “Cards” displaying text, actionable suggestions, or links to launch a [SMART](https://smarthealthit.org/) app from within the workflow.      |


Each workflow has associated `context` and `prefetch` FHIR resource returned from it.

If you use the `DataGenerator`, a pre-configured list of FHIR resources is randomly generated and placed in the `prefetch` field of a `CDSRequest`.

Current implemented workflows:

| Workflow      | Implementation Completeness        | Generated Synthetic Resources |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | -----------------------------
| [patient-view](https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/patient-view/) | :material-check-all:  | `Patient`, `Encounter` (Future: `MedicationStatement`, `AllergyIntolerance`)|
| [encounter-discharge](https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/encounter-discharge/)| :material-check-all: | `Patient`, `Encounter`, `Procedure`, `MedicationRequest`, Optional `DocumentReference` |
| [order-sign](https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/order-sign/)| :material-check: Partial | Future: `MedicationRequest`, `ProcedureRequest`, `ServiceRequest` |
| [order-select](https://cds-hooks.org/hooks/order-select/) | :material-check: Partial | Future: `MedicationRequest`, `ProcedureRequest`, `ServiceRequest` |


### Example `CDSRequest`

```json
{
   "hookInstance" : "23f1a303-991f-4118-86c5-11d99a39222e",
   "fhirServer" : "https://fhir.example.org",
   "hook" : "patient-view",
   "context" : {
     "patientId" : "1288992",
     "userId" : "Practitioner/example"
    },
   "prefetch" : {
      "patientToGreet" : {
        "resourceType" : "Patient",
        "gender" : "male",
        "birthDate" : "1925-12-23",
        "id" : "1288992",
        "active" : true
      }
   }
}
```
### Example `CDSResponse`

```json
{
  "summary": "Bilirubin: Based on the age of this patient consider overlaying bilirubin [Mass/volume] results over a time-based risk chart",
  "indicator": "info",
  "detail": "The focus of this app is to reduce the incidence of severe hyperbilirubinemia and bilirubin encephalopathy while minimizing the risks of unintended harm such as maternal anxiety, decreased breastfeeding, and unnecessary costs or treatment.",
  "source": {
    "label": "Intermountain",
    "url": null
  },

   }
  ]
}
