## Getting Started with Healthcare AI

HealthChain provides the missing middleware layer between healthcare systems and modern AI/ML development. Whether you're building clinical decision support tools, processing medical documents, or creating multi-system integrations, these docs will guide you through:

- **🔧 Core concepts** - Understand FHIR resources, pipelines, and gateway patterns
- **📚 Real examples** - Step-by-step tutorials for common healthcare AI use cases [coming soon]
- **🏗️ Advanced patterns** - Production deployment, authentication, and multi-EHR workflows
- **🧪 Testing tools** - Sandbox environments and utilities for development

## Common Use Cases You Can Build:

- 🚨 **CDS alerts for discharge summaries** - Generate clinical recommendations directly in Epic workflows
- 📋 **Automatic medical coding** - Extract ICD-10 or SNOMED-CT codes from physician notes with confidence scores
- 🔗 **Multi-EHR patient aggregation** - Combine patient records from Epic, Cerner, and specialty systems
- 🤖 **ML model deployment** - Serve your trained healthcare models as FHIR-compliant APIs
- 🔄 **Legacy document conversion** - Transform CDA documents to modern FHIR resources

**New to healthcare AI?** Start with our [Quickstart Guide](quickstart.md) to build your first medical NLP pipeline in under 10 minutes.

**Ready to integrate with EHRs?** Jump to our [Cookbook](cookbook/index.md) for complete examples including CDS Hooks and FHIR integration.

HealthChain is made by a small team with experience in software engineering, machine learning, and healthcare NLP. We understand that good data science is about more than just building models, and that good engineering is about more than just building systems. This rings especially true in healthcare, where people, processes, and technology all play a role in making an impact.
