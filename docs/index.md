## Why HealthChain?

You've probably heard every *AI will revolutionise healthcare* pitch by now, but if you're one of the people who think: wait, can we go beyond just vibe-checking and *actually* build products that are reliable, reactive, and easy to scale in complex healthcare systems? Then HealthChain is probably for you.

Specifically, HealthChain addresses two challenges:

1. **Scaling EHR integrations of real-time AI/NLP applications is a manual and time-consuming process.**

2. **Testing and evaluating unstructured data in complex, outcome focused systems is a challenging and labour-intensive task.**

We believe in doing one thing, but doing it well. Building in healthcare is about people, processes, and technology, and we believe there is a need for more robust versioning, validation and testing frameworks for AI models that integrate into EHR systems.

We believe more efficient end-to-end pipeline and integration testing at an early stage in development will give you back time to focus on what actually matters: developing safer, more effective and more explainable models that scale to real-world *adoption*. Building products for healthcare in a process that is *human*-centric.

<!-- HealthChain is made engineers and data scientists with experience in software engineering, machine learning, and NLP. We have worked with integrating real-time AI/NLP systems that have been deployed live at NHS trust sites. -->
