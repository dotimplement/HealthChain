## Why HealthChain?

You've probably heard every *AI will revolutionize healthcare* pitch by now, but if you're one of the people who think: wait, can we go beyond just vibe-checking and *actually* build products that are reliable, reactive, and easy to scale in complex healthcare systems? Then HealthChain is probably for you.

Specifically, HealthChain addresses two challenges:

1. **Scaling Electronic Health Record system (EHRs) integrations of real-time AI, NLP, and ML applications is a manual and time-consuming process.**

2. **Testing and evaluating unstructured data in complex, outcome focused systems is a challenging and labour-intensive task.**

We believe more efficient end-to-end pipeline and integration testing at an early stage in development will give you back time to focus on what actually matters: developing safer, more effective and more explainable models that scale to real-world *adoption*. Building products for healthcare in a process that is *human*-centric.

HealthChain is made by a (very) small team with experience in software engineering, machine learning, and healthcare NLP. We understand that good data science is about more than just building models, and that good engineering is about more than just building systems. This rings especially true in healthcare, where people, processes, and technology all play a role in making an impact.
